As I delve deeper into PHP and focus on building a solid foundation, this post will feature exercises from the book [PHP 8 for Absolute Beginners](https://amzn.to/3OQRJh4), and whenever possible, additional details and personal comments.

**Chapter 1: Getting Ready to Program**

1. Create a simple PHP program which displays your name, address, and paragraph of information about you using the _echo_ instruction.

```php
<?php

echo "Damiano Bacci";
echo "05035 Narni, Terni, Italy";
echo "I am junior web developer looking forward to learn PHP.";

?>
```

2. Create a PHP program which displays HTML code within the echo instruction.

```php
<?php

echo "<h1>This is a simple HTML page</h1>";
echo "<p>The page has a title and a paragraph.</p>";

?>
```

**Chapter 2: Understanding PHP, Language Basics**
